# Protocols Assignment
The task was to create a system using a broker and publish-subscribe techniques using UDP datagrams. The idea was that a “dashboard” could subscribe to certain topics from sensors and then these sensors would “publish” this information. The dashboard would also be able to “publish” to actuators and turn them off and on. The actuators would “subscribe” to the dashboard to receive the instructions.
